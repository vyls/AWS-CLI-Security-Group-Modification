# AWS-CLI Add/Remove Multiple Security Group Ingress/Inbound Rule
I create BASH and PowerShell script to add or remove AWS Security Group List  for Ingress/Inbound rule if we have multiple or many records. 

This script just use simple looping process.

You can use this script after configure your AWS CLI parameter.

If you still not install AWS-CLI, you can install it both on Windows or Linux with following this AWS Documentation:

Windows Installation
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html

Linux Installation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html



To Add and Remove Security group we need define the correct permission. Use this permission to Add/Remove for Ingress/Inbound rule:
"ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress"
"ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress"

And don't forget to use Resource is All - Resource": "*"



After you finish configure AWS user account for Add/Remove Security Group, then you can configure your AWS-CLI

Configure AWS-CLI:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html



After that, you can use these script both on Linux via Bash Shell or Windows via PowerShell.

I attach the sample of whitelist.txt file, change that with your security group ID, port, and subnet/CIDR

Windows PowerShell Example to Add AWS Ingress/Inbound Security Group:
Open PowerShell > Go to your directory file that store whitelist_aws_security_group.ps1 script
Execute whitelist_aws_security_group.ps1 then press Enter
Enter your whitelist file location
Then powershell script will execute the command

Windows PowerShell Example to Remove AWS Ingress/Inbound Security Group:
Open PowerShell > Go to your directory file that store remove_aws_security_group.ps1 script
Execute remove_aws_security_group.ps1 then press Enter
Enter your whitelist file location
Then powershell script will execute the command


Linux Bash Shell Example to Add AWS Ingress/Inbound Security Group:
Open terminal > Execute that bash script followed by whitelist file location
ex: ./whitelist_aws_security_group.sh /home/lindung/whitelist.txt

Linux Bash Shell Example to Remove AWS Ingress/Inbound Security Group:
